- All necessary authentication and networking libraries

## 🔐 **Security Setup**

- ✅ Service account created and configured
- ✅ Proper IAM permissions granted
- ✅ Secrets configured in `streamlit_secrets.toml`
- ✅ Sensitive files excluded from repository

## 🎯 **Next Steps for You**

1. **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud** (should take 1-2 minutes)
2. **Test the application** once deployment completes
3. **Upload a document** to verify corpus creation works
4. **Run a query** to test the RAG functionality

## 🛠 **What Was Changed**

### Code Changes:
- Moved `st.set_page_config()` to top of file (fixes Streamlit Cloud error)
- Restored your exact working local version
- Maintained all RAG configurations and document processing logic

### Dependencies:
- Added comprehensive list of Google Cloud dependencies
- Pinned versions for compatibility
- Included all authentication libraries

### Repository:
- Updated deployment guides
- Secured sensitive files
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After redeployment, your app should:
- ✅ Load without configuration errors
- ✅ Display the beautiful UI with custom styling
- ✅ Successfully connect to Google Cloud services
- ✅ Create RAG corpus and import documents
- ✅ Process queries and return relevant results

## 🆘 **If Issues Persist**

If you still encounter issues after redeployment:

1. **Check Streamlit Cloud logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify secrets** are properly configured in Streamlit Cloud settings
3. **Confirm service account permissions** in Google Cloud Console

The app has been tested locally and all dependencies are confirmed working. The deployment should now succeed on Streamlit Cloud.
